    lxqt-notificationd is LXQt's implementation of a daemon according to the Desktop Notifications Specification.
    This specification defines a way to display notifications in pop-up windows on desktops.

    lxqt-notificationd is running in a daemon-like manner as so-called LXQt Module and doing the actual work.
    GUI "Desktop Notifications", binary lxqt-config-notificationd, is used to customize the notifications.
    lxqt-notificationd is implementing version 1.2 of the said specification.
