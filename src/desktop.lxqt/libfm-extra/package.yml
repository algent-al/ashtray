summary    : A glib/gio-based lib used to develop file managers
description: |
    A glib/gio-based library providing some file management utilities and related-widgets missing in gtk+/glib.
    This is the core of PCManFM.
    The library is desktop independent (not LXDE specific) and has clean API.
    It can be used to develop other applications requiring file management functionality.
    For example, you can create your own file manager with facilities provided by libfm.
