summary    : The terminal widget for QTerminal
description: |
    A terminal emulator widget for Qt 5.
    QTermWidget is an open-source project originally based on the KDE4 Konsole application, but it took its own direction later on.
    The main goal of this project is to provide a unicode-enabled, embeddable Qt widget for using as a built-in console (or terminal emulation widget).
    It is compatible with BSD, Linux and OS X.
