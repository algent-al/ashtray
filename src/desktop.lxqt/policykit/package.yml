summary    : The LXQt PolicyKit agent
description: |
    lxqt-policykit is the polkit authentification agent of LXQt.
    polkit is a software framework to handle privileges of processes.
    In LXQt it is e. g. used to extend the privileges of the GUI tools of lxqt-admin.
    These are launched by a regular user.
    But in order to apply the settings they deal with root privileges are needed and acquired via polkit.
    Among the various components of polkit the authentication agent is the one to query the user for credentials by dialogue windows like this one of lxqt-policykit.
    While there's only a single implementation of all other polkit components various different authentication agents are provided by the various desktop environments.
    Basically these can be used interchangeably, that is lxqt-policykit can be used in an LXDE session or lxpolkit, the authentication agent of LXDE, can be used in an Xfce session.
    Most of the time it's better to use the implementation provided by a distinct desktop environment as it integrates better, though.
    Technically, lxqt-policykit is just a single binary lxqt-policykit-agent which is running as LXQt Module and launching the GUI on demand.
    Note that the naming lxqt-policykit is strictly speaking an anachronism.
    It refers to Policykit which was the predecessor of polkit.
    The name wasn't changed when Policykit was replaced by polkit as both provide roughly the same features albeit they are technically different.
