summary    : Tools for BPF-based Linux IO analysis, networking, monitoring, and more
description: |
  BCC is a toolkit for creating efficient kernel tracing and manipulation programs, and includes several useful tools and examples.
  It makes use of extended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filters), formally known as eBPF, a new feature that was first added to Linux 3.15.
  Much of what BCC uses requires Linux 4.1 and above.
