summary    : Various packaging tools and scripts for LXQt applications
description: |
    This package is providing several tools needed to build LXQt itself as well as other components maintained by the LXQt project.
    These tools used to be spread over the repositories of various other components and were summarized to ease dependency management.
    So far many components, in particular liblxqt, were representing a build dependency without being needed themselves but only because their repository was providing a subset of the tools which are now summarized here.
    So the use of this repository will reduce superfluous and bloated dependencies.
