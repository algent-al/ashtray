summary    : LXQt system administration tool
description: |
    This package is providing two GUI tools to adjust settings of the operating system LXQt is running on.
    Both are using polkit to handle permissions.
    In contrast to the specific backends described below earlier versions of lxqt-admin were relying on system-tools-backends and their wrapper liboobs.
    These were replaced as both go unmaintained for years and were hence dropped from many distributions heavily restricting the usage of lxqt-admin.
    As long as they can be built it should still be possible to compile lxqt-admin release â‰¤ 0.10 against them in order to make use of it on platforms lacking systemd like BSD.
