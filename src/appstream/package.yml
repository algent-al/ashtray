summary    : Infrastructure for distro-agnostic software-centers and universal software component metadata
networking : true
description: |
    AppStream is a cross-distro effort for enhancing the metadata available about software components in the Linux and free-software ecosystem.
    One of the project's goals is to make building software-center applications possible, and make interaction with the package sources of a distribution smarter.
    AppStream provides specifications for meta-information which is shipped by upstream projects and can be consumed by other software.
    The meta-information includes data which is interesting to display in software centers and is mainly useful for end-users, as well as descriptions about the public interfaces a software component provides, which is mainly useful for developers, 3rd-party software installers and for automatically installing missing components on a distribution, for example missing firmware or mimetype-handlers.
    Distributors provide metadata as well, which describes all components available in a software repository.
    That data is composed of the upstream-metainfo and some other sources.
    AppStream also provides specifications for things like a screenshot-service, application ratings & reviews etc.
    All parts of AppStream are distribution-agnostic, and therefore it is easily possible to build software management tools with it that work on any distribution implementing the AppStream specification.
